Falling Boxes is a simple, interactive browser game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective is to maneuver a player box to avoid falling obstacles and achieve the highest score possible. The game is designed with adjustable difficulty levels and a responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Gameplay**: Players can control the box using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or arrow keys.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, which adjust the speed and spawn rate of falling boxes.
- **Real-Time Score Tracking**: The game tracks your current score and displays it during gameplay.
- **High Score Persistence**: Your highest score is saved using `localStorage`, so it remains even after you close and reopen the game.
- **Customizable Settings**: Dimensions and movement speeds can be adjusted easily by modifying the game variables in the JavaScript file.
- **Simple, Intuitive Controls**: Designed for quick and easy gameplay, perfect for casual gaming.

## How It Works

1. **Starting the Game**:

   - On loading the game, you are presented with a menu where you can select the difficulty level and start the game.
   - Once the "Start" button is clicked, the menu fades out, and the game begins after a brief countdown.

2. **Gameplay**:

   - The player controls a box that moves up, down, left, and right within the play area.
   - Falling boxes of random colors and positions spawn at the top of the play area and move downwards.
   - Avoid colliding with the falling boxes to keep playing.
   - Each falling box successfully avoided increases your score.

3. **Collision and Game Over**:

   - If the player's box collides with a falling box, the game ends.
   - The menu reappears, and the player can restart the game or adjust the difficulty level.

4. **High Score**:
   - The game keeps track of the highest score achieved across all sessions using `localStorage`.
